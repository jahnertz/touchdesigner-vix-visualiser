# VIX visualizer
Proof of concept

## Requirements:
System python matching the touchdesigner version (currently 3.7.2)

## Installation
Run (cmd-r/ctrl-r) the text_template DAT to generate install scripts (Dep/dep_install.cmd for windows & Dep/dep_install.sh for mac). Run either of these to install python dependencies locally. The paths to these dependencies should have been added to touchdesigner on startup.
As a test, run the text_qrmaker DAT to generate a qrcode using one of the external libraries that has just been installed.
